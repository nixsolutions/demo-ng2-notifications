Angular 2.0 Demo Application - Notifications
===========================================

The application was built from scratch with Angular 2.0 following the recommended best practices.
This demo  is an unobtrusive notification system for web-based applications. This app can be used to inform users when specific actions have been completed in the app.
The app is designed to replace the code where you may have previously used the standard alert function to provide a feedback to a user. The alert function has two significant UI issues:

It is very obtrusive – users must take action (click "Ok") to remove the message or before you can interact with other elements on the page. While sometimes you want a user to acknowledge an action, you often just want them to pay attention to something without requiring them to take any additional action.
You cannot use rich-text–messages are limited to plain text only. Sometimes you want to provide rich-text features such as links or images in your notifications.
The app demonstrates a lightweight solution to all these problems.
